Commissions have been given for the copying of the rest
of the Surrzmc (namely Books X. and XL, De Simorala and
De Apostasia), and of all Wroarr's other Latin works except
the Philosophical ones and the Sermone.

4. The work of the first copiers employed was not satis-
factory, and the Committee found that there was no chance
of producing any inde endent Society book till 1884. They
therefore arran ed with Dr. Rudolf Baunan’smc, of Dreeden,
—whose apponi to English studente had in great measure
led to the foundation of the society-that the edition of
Wyclif'a Polema'cal Worlca, which he had undertaken in
Germany, should be issued also hore, with an English Intro·
duchon, N otes, etc, as the Society’s first Publication, vol. i.
for 1882, and vol. ii. for 1888, each volume consisting of about
600 peges. This work, the arrangement of which is, of
course, after the German manner, ie now ready, and contains
—besides a very valuable appreciative account of Wrcrar
end his work, critical apparatus,a list of the Vienna MSS,
and full Index—the following twenty-six Polemical ‘lhacts
(Shirley's numbers are added) :-
